# Casio Pocket Computers

A collection of information about Casio Pocket Computers. As a kid of the 80's mad
on computers these computers were so appealing. Back in the day I had a
[Casio PB-410](https://ithistory.org/db/hardware/casio-computer-co-ltd/casio-pb-410).

I've recently acquired a Casio FX-850P and a Casio VX-4. There doesn't appear to be
an emulator for these machines which would be a great help in writing BASIC programs.
So I've set myself a mission to try and get to that point, with the aid of the
[Retrochallenge Competition](https://www.retrochallenge.org) to spur me on.

## My Applications & Documentation

### [A Converter between Casio ASCII and Unicode](https://github.com/urbancamo/casio-basic)

This is a Scala Application to convert back and forth between Casio ASCII and Unicode.
The documentation includes a [reference card](casio-basic/doc/casio-ascii-to-unicode-converter.md)
showing the mapping between Unicode and Casio ASCII.

### [Casio FX-850P/FX-880P Online Manual](casio-basic/doc/casio-fx850-owners-manual.md)

As part of [RC2022/10](casio-basic/rc2022_10.md) I converted large parts of the original
[Casio FX-850P User Manual](casio-basic/doc/manuals/Casio_FX-850p_Owners_Manual.pdf)
to Markdown format for easy reference.

### [Retrochallenge October 2022 Entry](casio-basic/rc2022_10.md)

My retrochallenge focussed on developing the [Converter](https://github.com/urbancamo/casio-basic),
installing a modern day 32KB RAM expansion, the [RP-33](https://www.soigeneris.com/casio-rp-33-module-redux).
