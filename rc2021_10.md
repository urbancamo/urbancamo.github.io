# Urbancamo's Retrochallenge Entry for 2021/10

## First Update - 12-OCT-2021

Very late getting started on the project, mainly due to a keyboard failure. The DEC LK201 I have
stickered up for APL was poorly when I first used it after a while with a VAXstation 4000/90. 
I was able to determine it was probably the keyboard circuit that was faulty. At the 
recent [DEC Legacy](https://wickensonline.co.uk/declegacy/) event I was able to acquire another
keyboard and have successfully transplanted the keycaps onto the replacement keyboard structure and
controller. There was a number of ways I approached this but I took the time-consuming but lowest
risk approach.

So I finally have a VAXstation 4000/VLC running VAX/VMS 5.5 available to play with.
