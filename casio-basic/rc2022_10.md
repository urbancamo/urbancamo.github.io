*A Casio Basic Project - Parser and Interpreter*

This is my entry for the
[Retrochallenge 2022/10 Competition](https://www.retrochallenge.org/p/entrants-list-202210.html) and probably
subsequent challenges.

The Casio Pocket Computer range use a fairly standardized version
of BASIC called [Casio PocketPC BASIC](http://foroplus.com/basic/casiopbasic.php). This project is to create a parser for
BASIC using the programming language [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
and the parser library [fastparse](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/fastparse).

I have a couple of different Casio computers - I had a
[Casio PB-410](https://ithistory.org/db/hardware/casio-computer-co-ltd/casio-pb-410) when I was a kid and loved it.
Arguably the top-of-the-range model is the [FX-850P](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/20339/Casio-FX-850P/) and FX-880P. 
I now own one of these and have built a cable that allows me to download and upload files. This will allow
me to confirm correct behaviour of the parser/interpreter.

## Cosmic Fly
Cosmic Fly is a machine code game written for the Casio VX-4. It can be downloaded from [here](archives/CosmicV4.zip) and I
have formatted the [README in markdown format for easy reading](doc/CosmicV4/Readme.md) and more information
can be [found here](doc/CosmicV4/vx-4_jp.md).

## 31-OCT-2022 Wrap-Up

It is fairly normal for me to not complete my original goals for Retrochallenge. This month's attempt has fallen right
into that bracket. However, I've enjoyed my time delving into the Casio FX-850P manual, reproducing a fair portion of it
(complete from the perspective of the BASIC programming) and implementing that all important Casio ASCII to Unicode 
converter. This tool in itself makes it possibly to now publish Casio BASIC programs on the internet in a form
not previously possible, at least without installing a custom font.

In the past couple of days I've managed to create a new cable for the Casio VX-4 which is very cheap and convenient. 
Support for RS/232 over the 2.5mm 3-pole audio connector makes it much easier to fabricate a cable and once I got the 
null-modem connections on the [FT232RL adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0753GY7FR) correct it proved reliable.
I even managed to get the machine code game [Cosmic Fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbzH1f8HmNs) working!

Here are some links to the code in Cosmic Fly aka Cosmic V4:

So I feel like I've contributed by making the BASIC manual available and make look to fabricate some VX-4 RS/232 
adapters for sale on eBay for those who aren't a fan of the soldering iron.

So all the effort I've put into the [Converter](https://github.com/urbancamo/casio-basic/blob/main/src/main/scala/uk/m0nom/casio/basic/converter/Converter.scala) Scala
code has now paid off. The converter, as well as converting between Casio Basic ASCII and Unicode can now output a useful
markdown table showing the conversion mapping which can be seen on the [documentation page](doc/casio-ascii-to-unicode-converter.md) for the converter.

I've also been able to convert all the BASIC applications which form the Scientific Library built into the FX-850P & FX-880P.
[Part 11 - Scientific Library](doc/part-11-scientific-library.md) of my online manual now has a list of all the library routines including links 
to both the Unicode and Casio Basic source files. Having the Unicode versions available makes reading the BASIC source code,
containing all sorts of mathematical characters, really nice online.

What I didn't realise when I set out to write a parser for Casio BASIC is that a converter is a pre-requisite in order
to process text within a Scala application using Unicode, so even though I've not made much progress on a parser I had
to go down this route anyway!

Oh... and my VX-4 arrived. It comes with 8KB RAM which is pretty useless, so I ended up ordering a modern-day replacemnt
for the Casio RP-33 32KB RAM expansion module. See the developer [Birt's YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/c/HeyBirt) which 
includes [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3BDkjh6kNQ&t=6s) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSXBF3-MclE&t=619s)
of his video explaining the design of the replacement. They are currently available on eBay, his seller account
is [jeff_burt](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/jeff_birt).

I got the module installed today and am looking forward to exploring the machine, including the enhanced version of Casio Basic when
this RC entry is complete.

## 23-OCT-2022

I'm not making progress on the parser - but I am making progress on a conversion utility to convert Casio BASIC character
set pseudo-ASCII files into Unicode and back again. This is really a prerequisite to the parser, which works on the 
Unicode character setup. I've had fun-and-games with Unicode and Java/Scala because the 16-bit+ characters can't be stored
in a Java char - you must resort to converting character strings with more than one character into Unicode code points.

I also re-organised the Casio Basic documentation to mirror the standard owners manual, albeit with sections missing
at the moment that don't relate to BASIC. The new link is [Casio FX-850 Owners Manual](doc/casio-fx850-owners-manual.md).

## 09-OCT-2022

The [Casio Basic Language Reference Manual](doc/casio-fx850-owners-manual.md) is now 
fairly complete. On to the parser...

## 06-OCT-2022

Spent an hour entering documentation pages in Markdown format, will continue
to do so although this may become more of a background task moving forward, so
I can make progress on the parser. As far as I know there are no machine-readable versions of the documentation, so I see this as a worthwhile
endeavour.

Oh, and eBay beckoned, so I now have a Casio VX-4 being shipped from Japan.
This is a *very* interesting pocket computer, with support for C-language
programming. It was never exported, so all the documentation is in Japanese,
so it might turn into a more worthwhile project when it arrives converting the
documentation into English form - again, I'm unaware anyone has attempted
this.

## 04-OCT-2022

Started documenting [Casio Basic](doc/casio-basic-language-reference).

## 03-OCT-2022

First update! At the moment I am scouring the internet for Casio Pocket
Computer resources - I'll make a comprehensive resources list.

My first proper task will be to document the Casio Basic dialect, with all
options for the FX-850P. The language evolved as new models were released.

I've also found some sample programs which will be really useful when testing
the parser.
