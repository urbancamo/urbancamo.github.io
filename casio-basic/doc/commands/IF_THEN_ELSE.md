## IF ~ THEN ~ ELSE/IF ~ GOTO ~ ELSE

### Purpose 
Executes the `THEN` statement or [GOTO](GOTO.md) statement when the specified
condition is met. The `ELSE` statement is executed when the specified condition is not met.

### Format
```basic
                       { THEN       statement      } {      { statement        }
IF    condition        {          [ : statement]   } { ELSE {   [: statement   }
      ---------        {                           } {      {                  }
      Numeric          { GOTO   branch destination } {      {branch destination}
      expression

                    {  destination branch line number  }
                    {  -----------------------------   }
                    {           Line number            }
Branch destination: {                                  }
                    {  # program area number           }
                    {    ---------------------         }
                    {    Single character; 0~9         }
```

### Example
```basic
IF A=0 THEN 300 ELSE 400
IF K$="Y" THEN PRINT X ELSE PRINT Y
```

### Parameters 
1. branch condition: Numeric expression truncated to an integer
2. line number: Integer in the range of 1 <= line number <= 65535
3. program area number: Single character, 0 ~ 9

### Explanation
1. The statement following the `THEN` clause is executed, or execution jumps
to the destination specified by the [GOTO](GOTO.md) statement when the branch condition is met.
2. If the branch condition is not met, the statement following the `ELSE` statement is executed,
or the program jumps to the specifie branch destination. Execution proceeds to the 
next program line when the `ELSE` statement is omitted.
3. The format `IF A THEN ~` results in the condition being et when value of the expression (A) is not 0 (absolute value of A < 1 × 10⁻⁹⁹). The condition is not met when the value of the expression is 0.
4. `IF` statements can be nested (an `IF` statement may contain other `IF` statements).
In this case, the `THEN ~ ELSE` statements are related by their proximity.
The `GOTO ~ ELSE` combinations have the same relationships.

```basic
IF ~ THEN IF THEN ~ ELSE IF ~ THEN ~ ELSE ~ ELSE ~
|      |   |___|______|  |______|_____|       |
|______|______________________________________|
```

### Sample Program
```basic
10  INPUT "1 TO 9"; A
20  IF (0<A) AND (A<10) THEN PRINT "GOOD!" ELSE 10
```
"GOOD" is displaye for input values 1 to 9. Re-input is requested for other values.
