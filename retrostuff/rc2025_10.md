## Goals

Determine how good AI is at writing code for languages 
supported by the VAX/VMS operating system.

## Introduction

I've been using Claude Code for day to day development support when writing
code in Java, Scala, C# and other modern languages.

I'm curious to see how well it can handle older languages
like VAX BASIC, VAX Fortran and VAX Pascal.

I have an emulated VAXstation that has evolved over the years from an
original VAXstation 4000/90. The following languages are installed:

- VAX BASIC
- VAX Fortran
- VAX Pascal
- VAX C
- VAX C++
- VAX Macro Assembler
- VAX DCL
- VAX COBOL
- VAX APL
- VAX LISP

If I have time I may also install:
- VAX BLISS
- VAX ADA
- VAX PL/I

I'll spend a bit of time getting familiar with the languages again, and then
see how well Claude Code can help me write code in these languages.

I'll also see how well it can help me with DCL scripting.
I'll document my experiences here.
