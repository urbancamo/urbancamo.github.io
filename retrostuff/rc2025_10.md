## Goals

Determine how good AI is at writing code for languages 
supported by the VAX/VMS operating system.

## Introduction

I've been using Claude Code for day to day development support when writing
code in Java, Scala, C# and other modern languages.

I'm curious to see how well it can handle older languages
like VAX BASIC, VAX Fortran and VAX Pascal.

I have an emulated VAXstation that has evolved over the years from an
original VAXstation 4000/90. The following languages are installed:

- VAX BASIC
- VAX Fortran
- VAX Pascal
- VAX C
- VAX C++
- VAX Macro Assembler
- VAX DCL
- VAX COBOL
- VAX APL
- VAX LISP

If I have time I may also install:
- VAX BLISS
- VAX ADA
- VAX PL/I

I'll spend a bit of time getting familiar with the languages again, and then
see how well Claude Code can help me write code in these languages.

I'll also see how well it can help me with DCL scripting.
I'll document my experiences here.

## Updates

### 01-OCT-2025

Claude code has a terminal interface but I was unable to get it working with the 
retro-terminal emulator Reflection because it doesn't support UTF-8. I don't know
of a way to configure Claude to not display all the fancy terminal graphics, so it is 
pretty unusable which is a shame as other than the fancy graphics I could probably have
got this usable on my Windows 98 era Thinkpad. Instead I am using the Panasonic Toughbook
CF-31 which is running Ubuntu, although all I'm doing is ssh-ing into my HP Microserver
also running Ubuntu, but already setup for Claude Code (although I may switch to the laptop
if I decide this is the way to go).

Just as a starter for ten I thought I'd try a simple VAX Pascal Hello World program:

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ✻ Welcome to Claude Code!                         │
│                                                   │
│   /help for help, /status for your current setup  │
│                                                   │
│   cwd: /home/msw/code/rc2025_10                   │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results

> do you know how to program in VAX Pascal?

● Yes, I know VAX Pascal. It's a Pascal implementation by Digital Equipment Corporation for VAX systems, featuring extensions like
  variable-length strings, records with variants, and VAX-specific system calls.

  What VAX Pascal programming task can I help you with?

> can you write me a single hello world program

● program HelloWorld;
  begin
      writeln('Hello World');
  end.
```

I got an error compiling this file that I simply pasted back into the Claude code window:

```
> %PASCAL-E-OUTNOTDECL, (1) OUTPUT not declared in heading

● You need to declare the output file in the program header for VAX Pascal:

  program HelloWorld(output);
  begin
      writeln('Hello World');
  end.
```

The program then ran just fine on the VAX with the refinement:

```
MSW@ORAC$ type hello2.pas
program HelloWorld(output);
  begin
      writeln('Hello World');
  end.

MSW@ORAC$ pascal hello2.pas
MSW@ORAC$ link hello2
MSW@ORAC$ run hello2
Hello World
```
